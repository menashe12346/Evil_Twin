# üîê Evil Twin Attack & Defense Toolkit (Wi-Fi Pentest Project)

## üìö Overview

This project demonstrates both **offensive** and **defensive** techniques involving *Evil Twin* Wi-Fi attacks. It contains two major components:

1. **Evil Twin Attack Toolkit**:
   - Sets up a fake Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) with the same SSID as a real one.
   - Starts a captive portal and DHCP server.
   - Scans for connected clients.
   - Allows targeted *Deauthentication (Deauth)* attacks to disconnect users.
   - Wait for client to reconnect to fake AP
   - Capture credentials via login portal

2. **Evil Twin Defense Tool**:
   - Monitors nearby Wi-Fi networks in real-time.
   - Detects cloned SSIDs with different BSSIDs or signal anomalies.
   - Alerts the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Linux OS (tested on Arch/Ubuntu)
- Python 3.8+
- Wi-Fi adapter that supports:
  - Monitor mode
  - AP mode
  - Packet injection
- `hostapd` installed and accessible in PATH

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### üß™ 1. Evil Twin Attack Tool

```bash
cd attack
sudo python start_attack.py
```

This will:
1. Set interfaces to the required mode.
2. Ask you to choose a network.
3. Launch the fake AP.
4. Start captive portal on 192.168.1.1 & DHCP server.
5. Ask you to choose client to Launch the deauthentication attack on.
6. Capture credentials via login portal

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Evil Twin Detection Tool

```bash
cd defense
sudo python identify_evil_twin_attack.py
```

You will see real-time alerts if Evil Twin behavior is detected.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/menashe12346/evil_twin.git
cd evil_twin
```

2. Install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install hostapd
```

3. Install Python requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Make shell scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x change_interface_mode/*.sh
chmod +x attack/start_network.sh
```

5. Run scripts with `sudo` due to the need for low-level access to network interfaces.
